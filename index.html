    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Auto-Billing</h3>
    <p>For my summer internship, I took responsibility over designing and implementing a feature to the main customer portal that would allow clients to be automatically billed for any charges that occured during the prior day. I used React.JS primarily to implement the frontend and also used JavaScript with Stripe API to implement the backend. This addition went-live and was quickly adopted by 6 out of 50 clients.</p>
    <h3>CPU Design</h3>
    <p>I designed a 2-cycle pipelined processor using Logisim, a visual RTL, that successfully implemented the core RISC-V instruction set.</p>
    <h3>Git-let</h3>
    <p>I created a miniaturized version-control system using several Java classes to represent and serialize files and commits. </p>
